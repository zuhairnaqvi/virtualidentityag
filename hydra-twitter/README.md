What is TwitterBundle?
----------------------

This bundle is part of a collection of bundles that ease the access to social
media channels. The TwitterBundle is self contained, but can be integrated
with the AggregatorBundle (virtualidentityag/hydra) with which multiple social
media channels can be joined.

A nice bootstraped user interface is available for you to configure your api
requests and decide which tweets should appear in your feed.

TwitterBundle can be used to develop all kind of Twitter feed renderers.
