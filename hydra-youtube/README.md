What is YoutubeBundle?
----------------------

This bundle is part of a collection of bundles that ease the access to social
media channels. The YoutubeBundle is self contained, but can be integrated
with the AggregatorBundle (virtualidentityag/hydra) with which multiple social
media channels can be joined.

A nice bootstraped user interface is available for you to configure your api
requests and decide which tweets should appear in your feed.

YoutubeBundle can be used to develop all kind of Youtube feed renderers.

Requirements
------------

* YoutubeBundle is only supported on PHP 5.3.3 and up.
* We love Symfony and built this bundle for usage with it (Version 2.3+ required).
* For communication with Youtube we choosed to use themattharris/tmhoauth
